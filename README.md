# Productivity Book Backend
Technology has become a huge part of our lives. It has created useful solutions for making our lives easier, better, and improved the way we approach and do things. To-do lists have been part of human lives since the dawn of time. Only the way humans organize their to-do lists has changed. Some stick notes on their fridge and some have a small dairy that they carry everyday filled with to-do lists. We propose to you the productivity book. It’s a web application that allows users to manage their tasks and track their progress. There are various task list apps on the market but what differentiates productivity book from other applications on the market is that it provides users two unique facilities. One is to allow task sharing where they can add other users of the application to their tasks. The other unique feature is to receive reports of how well the user is finishing the tasks over time. We also give the user the ability to categorize their tasks so they can see much more detailed reports. Users will be able to access the application through the browser and interact with a web-based frontend. The UI/UX of the application is so simple and intuitive so the users don’t need a guide to use it.
